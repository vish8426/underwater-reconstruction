3D Reconstruction using Underwater Stereo Vision &amp; Scene Classification

## About
The following project highlights the process of constructing two overall programs and carrying out investigations utilizing these two systems. This includes a 3D 
using Underwater Stereo Vision, whereby, given stereo calibration and camera pose data is utilized alongside comparison to true terrain data. The second program includes a  Classification/Recognition system that can identify and classify specific objects in given images and assign semantic labels that describe the context of the environment.
